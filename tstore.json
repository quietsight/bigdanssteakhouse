He was born in the original Woodward Hospital to Dan \"The Milk Man\" and Merita Parsons back in 1963 and grew up learning that there is no replacement for hard work, integrity, and a friendly handshake. He met his wife Caryl at the University of Oklahoma, then spent several years honing his skills in the kitchens of the \"big city.\"\n\nIn 2009, Dan, Caryl and their son Eric moved back home to Woodward where years of restaurant experience and a friendly smile helped build Big Dan's Steakhouse into one of the best restaurants serving northwestern Oklahoma. Come on by and say \"howdy\" to Dan, Caryl and the crew. You'll be glad you did."}}
